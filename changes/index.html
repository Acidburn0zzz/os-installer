          <h4>A new installer</h4>
          <p>Possibly the biggest change since alpha8 is the introduction of this new installer. You can now install SolusOS 2 to your disk and experiment to your heart's content. Once you get SolusOS 2 installed, why don't you try your hand at packaging?</p>

          <h4>Firefox</h4>
          <p>We've replaced Midori with Firefox as our default web browser. We hope you enjoy browsing the web in comfort, just like you did with SolusOS 1. This release includes Firefox 24.0b7</p>

         <h4>LiveCD fixes</h4>
          <p>We've made some changes enabling a more fluid LiveCD experience. You no longer need a password to log in, or to use 'sudo'. You'll also notice that you were automatically logged in this time.</p>

          <h4>Security Updates</h4>
          <p>Several vulnerabilities in core packages have been addressed in our software repository. This release features updated packages to ensure your safety, even at this early testing stage in the life of SolusOS 2. We act on reports found on the National Vulnerability Database as soon as we can, and have security audit systems in place to constantly monitor our repositories.</p>

          <h4>Infrastructure changes</h4>
          <p>We've made some radical changes to the SolusOS infrastructure. Our source repository is now open to the public, and we converted it to Git. In addition, we've set up a Phabricator installation which will enable the community to contribute back to SolusOS in the form of code-fixes and packaging. All patches go through a code review system. For more information you can check the Infrastructure link on the SolusOS Website.</p>

          <h4>Included software</h4>
          <p><b>TODO:</b> Add brief overview of included software, CVE ID's and updated packages</p>
